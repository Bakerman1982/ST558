Cloning a Repo & Working in RStudio
We don’t want to use github.com web interface as that is inefficient.

We can clone the repo (i.e. download the entire repo locally).

Repo main page has a green button. Click on that.

Can download a zip and unzip it to an appropriate folder

Better to clone the repo via the URL and use RStudio! Open RStudio,

go to File –> new project
select from version control
choose Git
paste in the repo link
select a directory to save this repo in
hit create project!
Now have the files locally and this associates an R project with a git repo!

Try it with my repo here: https://github.com/jbpost2/ZScores.git

You won’t have access to push files to this repository though!
Try this out on your own! Create your own repo on github. Then try to download it as an R project.
